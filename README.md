# CNN_LSTM stock prices prediction
This repository is created to host my Bachelor's final project. I will mainly focus, on the creation of a deep learning architecture of CNN and LSTM combined to efficiently predict stock price movements. I will focus on an active trading strategy, each day is labelled as buy or sell given the price od the next day. I will use technical indicators, correlated assets and a modeled time window to create a 3D tensor that will behave as image for each trading day. The goal is assign labels to each trading day, configure the 3D tensor, train the model and hopefully predict the labels of future, unseen events.
