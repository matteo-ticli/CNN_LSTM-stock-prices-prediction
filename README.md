# CNN_LSTM stock prices prediction
This repository was created, to host my Bachelor's Degree final project. I will mainly focus on the creation of a deep learning architecture: CNN+LSTM to efficiently predict stock price movements. I will focus on an active trading strategy, each day is labeled as buy (1) or sell (0) given the price of the next day. I will use technical indicators, correlated assets, and a modeled time window to create a 3D tensor that will behave as the image for each trading day. The goal is to assign labels to each trading day, configure the 3D tensor, train the model and hopefully predict the labels of future, unseen events.
